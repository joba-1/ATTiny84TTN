WARNING:

I use the january panel version, but it does not work as is because I got MISO/MOSI wrong.
That means MISO/MOSI works for programming the ATTiny via the ISP header only.
It does not work with the RFM95W and the SPI header to the BME280 connected 1:1.

This should be fixed in the march version, but is untested yet.
Use at your own risk :)
